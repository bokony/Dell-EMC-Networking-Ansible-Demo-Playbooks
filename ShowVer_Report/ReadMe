The playbook names are self explanitory for the type of system they operate upon.

These files are intended to be used demonstration files for automation of DellEMC Networking devices.   The configuration is static and based on private IP addressing for interfaces on the virtual instances. 

The inventory.yaml file will need to be updated to reflect the IP addresses of your local environment.  You may also choose to modify the host names.

Note changes to the Ansible.cfg file to reflect the path to the inventory.yaml file.  Also modifications to the SSH Key paramenters have been changed.   It recommended to review these SSH key modifications to match your production system requirements if you choose to use these playbooks in your environment.
